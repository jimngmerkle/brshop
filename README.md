## Overview of the app - 

The navigation feels very smooth because of react router dom, the site doesn't actually reload, it just changes some components which are necessary and stated inside by me.
I wrote most of the functions in App.jsx and then sent them down to child components as props and used them in the components.

## Running locally - 

To run this project locally you'll need to clone the repo then install dependencies using 

```
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn install
``` 

then run 

```
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
``` 

as vite has added a script stating dev builtin here it'll execute the script and start the dev server on - http://localhost:5173/.
